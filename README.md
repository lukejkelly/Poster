A Tikz poster template adapted from [James Lloyd's](https://github.com/jamesrobertlloyd/cbl-tikz-poster).

The header and main body of the poster are treated separately, but in both cases nodes and the lines separating them are placed relative to each other starting from the top-left corner.

I haven't included my macros or bib files, nor the Branding/ and figures directories.
